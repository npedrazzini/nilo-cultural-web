I"ü	<p>You should all have created your own blog using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> by now - if not, the following is a quick sum-up of what we did to set it up:</p>

<ol class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Fork https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Rename the forked repo to yourusername.github.io (or yourusername.github.io/repositoryname)</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Clone the forked repo in your machine</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Head to yourusername.github.io (or yourusername.github.io/repositoryname) and check what it looks like out-of-the-box</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Edit the _config.yml file with your info (blog title, description, social media, etc.)</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Create your first post</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see, I havenâ€™t ticked point 3, since you havenâ€™t seen that yet, but itâ€™s good practice to work locally and use Git to sync your local repo with your remote repo (in your case, GitHub (Pages)).</p>

<p>You should also have familiarized yourself with Markdown a little. Itâ€™s really easy and knowing a few extra tricks will make your blogging a bit more fun.</p>

<p>:exclamation: :exclamation: :exclamation: <a href="https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf">Here</a> is a Markdown cheat sheet (but you can Google stuff as needed - youâ€™ll find a wealth of information, including <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji">how to add an emoji plug-in</a> to Jekyll  :umbrella:).</p>

<p>As you know, Jekyll is written in Ruby. You wonâ€™t need to know a lot about it, but grasping some of the basics will take you a long way. For the purpose of this module, perhaps the following will be more than enough:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to install Ruby and check its version</li>
  <li>What are Gems</li>
  <li>How to add stuff to the â€˜Gemfileâ€™</li>
</ul>

<p>This should however not take the focus away from your main goals here, which is building your own DH website.</p>
