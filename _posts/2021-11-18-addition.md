title: Important addition to Jekyll troubleshooting
---
Thanks to Luyu Feng for making me realize that my MacOS demonstration did not include an explanation on how to update your [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download). This might have created issues for some of you. RubyGems already comes with your MacOS, but just like Ruby itself it is outdated. If you still have issues running your gems (like jekyll), please update RubyGems by running:

`gem update --system`

Do a cleanup of outdated gems:

`gem cleanup`

And reinstall any needed gems:

`gem install bundler jekyll`

Then test that Jekyll works by creating a new website:

`jekyll new invent-a-name-for-your-ws`

Move inside the newly created website:

`cd invent-a-name-for-your-ws`

Add Webrick:

`bundle add webrick`

`bundle install`

Test the website:

`bundle exec jekyll serve`
