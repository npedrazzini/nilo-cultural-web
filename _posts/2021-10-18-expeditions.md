title: Expeditions and blogging

When going to virtual expeditions, ask yourselves and note down thoughts on questions such as:

* When and why was this archive created? Try doing some background research on Wikipedia before your visit.
* Where did the objects come from? Under what circumstances were they acquired?
* Who is the archive made for? What are visitors expected to know? What are they expected to do, think and feel? Is the archive made for your visit?
* What are the 'conditions of possibility' for this archive to exist. Do you think this has been put together by a small team, maybe even a team of volunteers? Or a global corporation? An empire? How does the website embody and express these conditions of possibility?
* What taxonomies (categories and tags) do they use to organise their collections?
* What metadata do they employ and display?
* What third-party platforms are they using? Eg, Google Street View, Sketchfab. Keep an eye on your URL bar.

> Write a blog post of 500 words or more on your visit, discussing some (not necessarily all) of the above. Pick one object that you found in your expedition. Focus on what is interesting.
