### Background
Running since 1964, the Wildlife Photographer of the Year is a prestigious international wildlife photography competition, organized and awarded by the Natural History Museum in London, England. 
Winning and highly commended photographs are selected across a number of categories, reflecting different aspects of wildlife and the seniority of the photographers. The selection is displayed in the eponymous world-touring exhibition starting at the NHM in London.

### Layout
A selection of thumbnail-sized winning and commended photographs are immediately presented as one opens the website, with two-to-three photos displayed per row. Winners are highlighted by a 'Winner' label. By enlarging or reducing the size of the window, the layout stays identical (i.e. the photo preview on the main page are adusted in size, but the number of photos per row and their position remains the same).  Each image is hyperlinked and directs you to an individual photo page, which includes metadata about the photographer, the equipment used to take the photo, and the categories to which they belong. The individual photo pages show a bigger-size image, with the tags/categories in the sidebar on its left and the remaining metadata just below the photo itself.

### Filter functionality
What does it allow you to choose? What tags/categories?

### Overall User Experience (UX)
UX assessment is a complex task: focus on those aspects which you think are relevant for your goals. A couple of resources (papers) on assessing UX of online museum collections are ([^1]) and ([^2])). ([^1]) has a table with a series of comments from bad to excellent regarding different aspects of UX. You can use that as a guidelines on the type of aspects you might want to address.
